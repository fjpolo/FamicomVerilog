            *  - Processor Status Register (P): The status register holds various flags, including the carry flag (C), 
            * zero flag (Z), interrupt disable flag (I), decimal mode flag (D), break flag (B), overflow flag (V), and 
            * negative flag (N). You should initialize this register according to your desired initial state of these 
            * flags. For example, if you want all flags to be cleared, you can set it to 8'h20 (with the interrupt 
            * disable flag set to 1).
            *
            *  - Interrupt Signals: The 6502 CPU has three interrupt signals: IRQ, NMI, and RESET_OUT. During reset, it 
            * is common to assert the RESET_OUT signal to inform external components that the CPU is being reset. You can 
            * initialize this signal to a high level (e.g., 1'b1) during reset.
            *
            *  - Additional Registers and Signals: Depending on the specific features and extensions you have implemented 
            * in your 6502 CPU design, you may have additional registers or signals that require initialization. These could 
            * include special-purpose registers, control signals, or internal flags. Ensure that any additional registers or 
            * signals in your CPU module are properly initialized to their intended initial values.

    *  - Identify the Instructions: Determine the set of instructions supported by your CPU architecture. This includes understanding 
    * the opcode values and the corresponding operations each instruction should perform.
    *
    *  - Create Modules or Functions: For each instruction, create a separate module or function that implements the specific operation. 
    * The inputs to the module or function would typically include the relevant operands, such as registers or memory locations, and the 
    * outputs would represent the result of the operation.
    *
    *  - Integrate the Modules: Integrate the modules or functions into the main CPU module. Connect the inputs and outputs of the 
    * instruction modules to the appropriate signals or registers within the CPU module. Use conditional statements or case statements to 
    * select the appropriate instruction module based on the instruction opcode.
    *
    *  - Handle Instruction Execution: Within the main CPU module, based on the instruction opcode, you would activate the corresponding 
    * module or function to execute the instruction. This could involve providing the required operands and capturing the result of the 
    * operation. Update the necessary registers and signals accordingly.
    *
    *  - Test and Verify: Test your CPU implementation with different instructions to ensure they are executed correctly and produce the 
    * expected results. Verify the correctness of the implementation by comparing the outputs with the expected values.
